# ACR122 Card Reading Demo

This example project has two different demos, one for reading ISO14443-3 and one for ISO14443-4.

## ISO14443-3

This is a simple example because the library can read these tags by default without any extra processing to get the card's UID.

## ISO14443-4

This example has to manually ask the reader to get the card's UID.
